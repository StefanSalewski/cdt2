This is an Incremental (Fully Dynamic) Constrained_Delaunay_Triangulation written
from scratch in the Nim programming language.

The implementation is based on the Kallmann paper

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2478154_Fully_Dynamic_Constrained_Delaunay_Triangulations

and some other papers cited in the source code.

While the initial version followed strictly the papers and basically worked well, it was discovered during
actually using it, that the API design does not work well with inheritance and OOP programming
style. So for this version we are in the process of modifying the API a bit and so called it cdt2.
Maybe later we can join both versions, but for now we need total freedon for API changes.

This cdt2 version is used for the PCB rubberband router: https://github.com/StefanSalewski/RBR

As underlying data structure the Quad-Edge structure is used. For point location we use the
"jump and walk" algorithm, which is very simple and generally fast enough.

We added "cursor" annotation to the  Quad-Edge data structure to enable compiling with ARC
memory management.

This type of CDT allows insertion and removal of points and line segments in arbitrary order.
Intersecting and overlapping segments as well as duplicated points are supported. Typical
running time for triangulations with N vertices is O(N ^ (1/3)) for single insert or delete operations,
which is not too far away from the optimal (log N) case.
 
As this is an early draft, much more testing is necessary. (Well known problems for CDTs can
be numerically instabilities.) The API will change when we start using this library, it may become
more generic, and more traversal operations will be added.

Maybe most serious limitation is, that we have to specify an initial bounding box for all of our data
points when we create the CDT. This is a common practice and simplifies the algorithm. Maybe later we
can remove this restriction.

For testing currently the files test0.nim and test.nim are provided. Test0.nim is a very basic
test with only textual output. Test.nim generates graphical output as shown above, but you need
GTK3 and gintro Nim bindings for it.

Sketch of basic use is like this:

[[t0.nim]]
[source,nim]
.t0.nim

import cdt/[dt, vectors, edges, types]

proc main =
  var dt: DelaunayTriangulation = initDelaunayTriangulation(initVector(minX, minY), initVector(maxX, maxY))
  discard dt.insert(Vector(x: 5, y: 10)) # insert a single point
  let cid dt.insert(Vector(x: 20, y: 30), Vector(x: 30, y: 90)) # insert a constrained line segment
  discard dt.removeConstraint(cid) # remove an segment

main()
